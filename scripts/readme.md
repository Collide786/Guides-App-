Need to make it so that the user who created the guide can delete it and possibly re-edit it


Link the email with 
<a href="#" class="blue-text text-darken-4 modal-trigger" data-target="modal-bio">Bio</a>
  <div id="modal-bio" class="modal">
    <div class="modal-content">
      <h1> Worked </h1>
    </div>
  </div>

so that when you press the email it takes you to there bio.
